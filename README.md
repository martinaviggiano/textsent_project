# textsent_project

This project is based on the analysis of textual data, with the aim to detect hate speech.
We employed the dataset from the white supremacist Stormfront forum, manually labelled at sentence level. In particular, data were taken from the Github repository hate-speech-dataset by Vicomtech. https://github.com/Vicomtech/hate-speech-dataset

## Note

The work has been split in 3 pages:
- \_Pre-processing data\_ in which we cleaned data;
- \_Data analysis\_ in which we made some descriptive analysis;
- \_Models\_ in which we porformed different statistic methods on data. 

## Usage

```python

```
